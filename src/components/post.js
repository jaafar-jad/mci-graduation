            Life can get really busy, so it's no surprise if you find yourself distracted from studying by thoughts about everything else. Rather than acting like all of those other needs don't exist, give yourself an outlet. Spend 5 minutes thinking about everything that's on your plate, but then tell yourself it's time to focus on the main task for now: studying.

             A common time management trap many people fall into is that they don't know where their time goes, or they overestimate the amount of time they have available and underestimate the amount of time each activity takes to complete, and become overcommitted. If this sounds like your days, you may need to keep a careful schedule, writing down everything you do. Don't agree to new activities until you've found a way to pencil them in, overestimating the amount of time you think it will take to complete them.

             Time, we have a limited amount of it, but it is something many of us squander away.
“Time is free, but it’s priceless. You can’t own it, but you can use it. You can’t keep it, but you can spend it. Once you’ve lost it you can never get it back
 so use them wisely and start immediately.            </p>

             Any goal worth completing is not going to be easy. If you think living your dreams is simple and you are entitled to it, you will never achieve it. The first step is dedicating yourself to a goal and knowing that it will not be easy to complete it, but it will be worth it.
